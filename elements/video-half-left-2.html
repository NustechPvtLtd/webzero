                    <p>So, what is the secret of successful template design? First of all, it is its friendliness – both for the template’s owner and for his or her future targeted audience. UX and UI are not just empty phrases for us. It is very important for us that the user could understand correctly the message  your project’s trying to say to him or her. But, correct giving of the information is just a half of success.</p>
